# Implementing Face Detecting on Webcam using Cascade Classifier 
FaceDetectorCascadeClassifier

## Why

Emotion detectors are used in many industries, one being the media industry where it is important for the companies to determine the public reaction to their products.

## Introduction

Haar-cascades are classifiers that are used to detect features (of face in this case) by superimposing predefined patterns over face segments and are used as XML files. In our model, we shall use face, eye and smile haar-cascades, which after downloading need to be placed in the working directory.

## System

1. Capturing live feed: The live feed coming from the webcam/video device is processed frame by frame
2. Detecting face
3. Detecting eyes
4. Detecting smile

## Output
