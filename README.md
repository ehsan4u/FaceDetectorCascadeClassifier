# FaceDetectorCascadeClassifier
Implementing Face Detecting on Webcam using Cascade Classifier

Haar-cascades are classifiers that are used to detect features (of face in this case) by superimposing predefined patterns over face segments and are used as XML files. In our model, we shall use face, eye and smile haar-cascades, which after downloading need to be placed in the working directory.
